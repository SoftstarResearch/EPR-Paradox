Einstien EPR Paradox

EPR paradox
The Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox or the EPR paradox of 1935 is a thought experiment in quantum mechanics with which Albert Einstein and his colleagues Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen claimed to demonstrate that the wave function does not provide a complete description of physical reality, and hence that the Copenhagen interpretation is unsatisfactory; resolutions of the paradox have important implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Quantum Entanglement

Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when pairs or groups of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in ways such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently of the state of the others, even when the particles are separated by a large distance.  Of this entire explination relies on a vecor of thought that has so far been proven through experimentation in the lab.  
Or has it?

Quantum Synchronization

I believe that Einstein was right when it comes to the model of space-time that doesn’t allow for the instant communication between two particles (notwithstanding the idea of folded space-time, but that’s another discussion).  
Then what else could explain the observation thus far.  The explanation would have to account for all the current mathematical models yielding positive results from their equations.  This would include the famous double slit experiment, which says that little particles of matter have something of a wave about them.  The experiment suggests that the very act of observing a particle has a dramatic effect on its behavior. 
One problem here is the entire premise is still dependent on the observations made that were designed to support the supposition itself.  But what if there was another explanation for the observations.
Measurement Scale
Here’s a bit of the thought experiment.  1st off, some foundational assumptions.  Let start with a common understanding that in order to take a measurement of anything, there must be some scale that the measurement is compared against.  Otherwise what value is the measurement.  
That being said, if we apply that assumption to the quantum world, then in order to measure any property of any particular particle, there has to be some kind of a scale, and that scale has to be in somewhat finite, otherwise measuring anything against it would be meaningless.  
So, if the different properties of a particle are finite, then we can identify that with a scalar variable ‘X’.
Measurement Mechanism
Again, one of my issues with the entire field of Quantum Entanglement is that of the measurement mechanism.  No matter what hypothesis is being evaluated, the mechanism of measurement itself will always be in question.  
Therefore the 2nd assumption is that the standard deviation of error rates with any measurement mechanism being used will be the same regardless of the theory being pursued.  In other words, what ever errors are introduced into any experiment by the measurement mechanism itself will be the same errors across all experiments.  This is important as it eliminates the measurement error ration as a discrete variable in any kind of algorithm.
Measurement Experiments
Most (if not all) experiments today that deal with Entanglement start off by splitting photons.  We can start there.  Given that we’ve already established there’s a finite number of states for the particle (X), splitting that particle would also result in a finite number of states.  Simple probability mathematics tells us that if the number of photons split is a multiple of ‘X’, then more than one particle with exhibit the exact same properties as another.  
In other word, there’s the probability that some number of photons split will show exactly the same characteristics as their partner, such that they’ll look like they’re completely synchronized, and a measurement of one at any point in space-time, would yield the exact same ‘know result’ as the synchronized one, therefore, satisfying the quantum entanglement with no instant communication.
Superposition, which states that particles can be in several places or states at once, gets reduced simply to mathematical probabilities.  
Instead of the idea that the second you observe a quantum system, it picks a specific location or state, quantum synchronization mathematically yields the same results.
